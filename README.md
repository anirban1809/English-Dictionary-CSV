I got the word meanings from <a href="http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/%7Eralph/OPTED/" target="_blank">OPTED(The Online Plain Text English Dictionary),</a> which is based on “<em><strong>The Project Gutenberg Etext of Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary</strong></em>” which is in turn based on the 1913 US Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary (See <a href="http://www.promo.net/pg/">Project Gutenburg</a>), as a t<em><strong>ext file</strong></em>.</p>
<p>I then converted the text files into<strong> csv</strong>. I am sharing those here if anyone needs them.</p>
